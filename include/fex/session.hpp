// fex/session.hpp - high-level entry point.
//
// A Session owns:
//   - the open /dev/fuse fd,
//   - the mount (set up via fsopen/fsconfig/fsmount/move_mount),
//   - a pool of per-queue io_uring rings that carry every post-INIT
//     request and reply.
//
// Transport: every request and reply travels over FUSE-over-io_uring
// (`IORING_OP_URING_CMD` with `FUSE_IO_URING_CMD_REGISTER` /
// `FUSE_IO_URING_CMD_COMMIT_AND_FETCH`), including the mount-time
// handshake (INIT / LOOKUP_ROOT / STATX). The daemon registers ring
// entries between `fsconfig(SET_FD)` and `fsconfig(CMD_CREATE)`, and
// the kernel's `fusex_fill_super` then routes INIT through the rings
// like any other request. `/dev/fuse` is the channel fd that carries
// the URING_CMD opcodes; `read()`/`write()` on it fail for a fusex
// connection.
//
// Concurrency: the kernel has one FUSE queue per possible CPU. There are
// `uring_threads` worker threads, each owning one ring with
// `uring_queue_depth` entries for each of the queues assigned to it.
// Callbacks may run concurrently on all the workers — `Filesystem`
// implementations must be thread-safe.
//
// Typical use:
//
//     MyFilesystem fs{...};
//     fex::Session s(fex::SessionOptions{
//         .mountpoint = "/mnt/myfs",
//         .fsname     = "myfs",
//     });
//     s.run(fs);                  // blocks until unmount
//
// `run()` is the foreground entry; `stop()` from another thread (or a
// signal handler) makes it write back what is dirty and unmount.
